"App is useful to certain phone brand ,,,,it is not excepted to all the phone ,,,,I have tried so many phone to use but no results yet to be determined by me ","Worst customer service. Very scripted, refuse to take responsibility or provide any compensation when their streaming services fail on a device. Clearly the management is lacking in good business principles and want to make a cheap buck ","For an app who's sole purpose is to stream entertainment it's absolutely rubbish when casting or the like. Some of the content is ok but it fails as a versitile streaming app. ","Have had netflix since it first went digital. Canceled membership today. I'm not paying $8 extra dollars a month on top of the $16 I already pay for my 90 year old grandma to be able to watch now and then. In addition....now I can't even use my own account that I pay for on other TVs when I'm traveling for work or at a friends house? Get lost. I'll give Nana my other streaming passwords. Greedy nonsense. ","I have the premium account and the past few months, i seem to have a daily update on my Devices as I have two homes to come home to alternately and lately I keep on updating devices once or twice a day, what is going on with this. It's irritating and I am hanging on a thread thinking if I should cancel my account soon. ","Expensive and poor picture quality ","dissapointment, netflix has took many good games and if you want to play these you need a netflix account which you need to pay the membership for the account, and it really expensive. So yeah i can't play my fav game without paying netflix... I hate this ","","",""
"I just installed the app. But when I open it, it crashed. I uninstall then install it again but nothing change. Please fix it. I just want to watch movies.. ðŸ˜¢ ","After an update, playback specification will automatically switches to L3 widevine which means only in SD. ALWAYS NEED TO REINSTALL AGAIN IN ORDER TO HAVE L1 WIDEVINE FOR HD CONTENT ","The app is not working. The whole screen is black when opening it. ","THIS APP GETS RID OF THE BEST SHOWS! LIKE JULIE AND THE PHANTOMS!!! CALL ME BY YOUR NAME! LIKE... AHHH NETLFIX PLEASE STOOOOPPPP (but overall it's a good app) ","I don't understand why I have to register with a card when I can just use mpesa. Moved with the times. ","I am going to unlike all and any documentaries on Netflix, in an attempt to get this app to stop showing Adolf Hilter faces on my screen. If this doesn't help, I will cancel my Netflix subscription and find another service. You can always make an option to allow or disable Hitler faces from being shown. Hurry up with this. ","plays well. navigation, looking for films, is terrible. shows the same films over and over in different rows you have to scroll through. extremely annoying. ","","",""
"I enjoy Netflix as much as anyone else but why does Netflix keep notifying me of personalized recommendations on the ps4 streaming access? Yet no matter how many times I acknowledge this I keep getting notified. it even started notifying back to back...got so ridiculous I just turned off the ps4 cause everytime the notification comes through all the apps reset and try to get me to go through the start process like I just downloaded them ðŸ˜­. ","I just wish all foreign TV shows (K- drama) Audio were English. But overall was excellent. ","I'm not even able to download any movies or series in my profile. I tried many times but even the settings is not helpful ðŸ˜• please check that. Why is Netflix having a glitch ?? I can't properly watch any of the series or movies ðŸ˜ž Please do check and help ","I am a truck driver so my location changes all the time tired of having to keep signing in and out to just be able to watch a show ","Honestly the app works just fine and I generally have no issue with it, but every once in a while it would randomly lower its playback specs to widevine L3 where I usually get L1. This is really annoying since the only way to fix it is by clearing the app cache and reinstalling the app again, just fix this please. ","there isn't inside out, Heather the musical, THE LITTLE PRINCE, basically a lot of things but I like it PLEASE ADD THE LITTLE PRINCE ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ ","Good but fricking expensive. Family can't share account. Netflix original content sucks. My liked and requested shows and movies are not there. Disappointing. ","","",""
"Overall Satisfactory, one suggestion might be to include TVs in the temporary access function of devices outside the Household, the feature include phones, tablets, and desktops but not TVs ","Works properly but sometimes it lags and not many good shows/movies. like sometimes I wish Harry Potter was on here. ","Fast/complete ","I enjoy the app fairly well, but i can not stand that I can not put it into a miniscreen. I have other things to do on my phone, and with no miniscreen option, it makes me prefer to just watch disney+ or YouTube. The household rules don't bother me much but when it does randomly pop up its annoying to have to go through the verification just for it to tell me I have a week before I need to redo it or something. ","Just a small feature request - along with displaying the cast, genre, and other details on the info page of a movie or series, it would be fantastic if the available languages could also be included. ","Netflix is always the best. But I wish it would stop taking away my favorite series and movies. Overall, amazing app and easy-to-use!! ","My experience is very good but most of the drama are not dubbed ","","",""
"Best app fOr movies ","I love to watch the movie's you have on here and the TV shows I love them ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’— ","Great app with good variety, but currently you hae a little bug on the mobile version, when you plug in headphones and you have audio the video will give me subtitles, i then have to select the subtitles activate because it comes up as off then have to repeat again to select stop, please fix as i frequently use headphones and its a pain to do every time i select something to watch (doesn't happen on auto play)thanks ","Netflix is â€‹â€‹a great medium for movies and TV shows. I hope more great movies and series will come on Netflix. ","Because you can watch movies and relax while it plays and I can just give this 5 starts for everything it does ","maybe i share my experience to how use the netflix, it because so beautiful but very hard how to create an account, but solid haha ","I love cause it has what i want go Netflix but where's the originals and legacies please put it soon ","","",""
